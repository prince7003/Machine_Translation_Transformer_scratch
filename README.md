# Machine Translation using Transformer from Scratch

## Overview

This repository implements a **Machine Translation** task using the Transformer architecture from scratch. The project showcases how to build a neural machine translation model capable of translating sentences from a source language to a target language, leveraging the power of **self-attention** and **multi-head attention** mechanisms.

The model is inspired by the paper "[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)" and is implemented in **Python** using **PyTorch** for deep learning.

## Features

- **End-to-End Machine Translation**: Translates sentences from a source language to a target language.
- **Transformer Model**: Built from scratch using multi-head attention, positional encodings, encoder-decoder architecture, and more.
- **Customizable Hyperparameters**: Easy tuning for parameters such as the number of attention heads, layers, and hidden units.
- **Tokenization**: Preprocessing with custom tokenizers or using libraries like **spaCy** and **NLTK**.
- **Training Loop**: Includes loss computation, backpropagation, and gradient clipping for stability.
- **Evaluation**: BLEU score computation for translation quality.

## Architecture

The Transformer model is based on the following components:

- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: 
  - The **Encoder** processes the source sentence and produces a context vector.
  - The **Decoder** takes the context vector and translates it into the target sentence.
  
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sentence at each layer.
  
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in a sequence.

- **Feed-Forward Networks**: After attention layers, these networks help capture complex patterns in the data.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch spacy nltk tqdm
```

Youâ€™ll also need a trained tokenizer for your language pairs. You can use **spaCy** or **NLTK** to handle this.

---

## Data

For training, the model uses a dataset consisting of parallel sentences in both the source and target languages (e.g., English to French). You can use popular datasets such as **WMT**, **IWSLT**, or **Multi30k**.

To prepare the data:

1. **Tokenize** both the source and target sentences.
2. Convert sentences into **integer sequences** (word IDs).
3. **Pad** sequences to a fixed length for batching.

---

## Model Training

To train the model, execute the following script:

```bash
python train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32 --learning_rate 0.0001
```

- **Batch Size**: Number of sentences processed per step.
- **Epochs**: Number of full training passes over the data.
- **Learning Rate**: Step size for the optimization algorithm.

During training, the model computes the **Cross-Entropy Loss** between predicted and true tokens and backpropagates gradients to optimize parameters.

---

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance using **BLEU score**, a common metric for machine translation quality. You can run the evaluation script as follows:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path best_model.pt --data_path test_data.txt
```

---

## Results

After training, the model should be able to generate fluent and accurate translations. The BLEU score will indicate translation quality, and the sample outputs will be in the `results/` directory for review.

---

## Usage

You can translate sentences using the trained model by running:

```bash
python translate.py --sentence "Translate this sentence" --model_path best_model.pt
```

Replace `"Translate this sentence"` with the sentence you'd like to translate, and it will output the translation in the target language.

---

## Hyperparameters

The model allows you to adjust various hyperparameters, including:

- **Embedding Dimension**: The size of token embeddings.
- **Number of Layers**: The number of layers in the encoder and decoder.
- **Attention Heads**: The number of attention heads in each multi-head attention block.
- **Feedforward Dimension**: The size of the hidden layers in the feedforward networks.
  
You can modify these parameters in the config file or directly through command-line arguments.

---

## Future Work

- Integrating **beam search** to improve translation output.
- Adding **BPE tokenization** for better vocabulary management.
- Experimenting with **larger datasets** and **language pairs**.
- Fine-tuning the model with pre-trained transformer-based models like **BERT** or **GPT**.
